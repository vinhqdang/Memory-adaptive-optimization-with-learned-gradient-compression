# Memory-Adaptive Optimization with Learned Gradient Compression
## ICLR 2025 Research Plan

### Executive Summary
We propose **MANGO** (Memory-Adaptive Neural Gradient Optimizer), a novel optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts memory allocation between gradient precision and optimizer states based on training dynamics. Unlike existing methods with fixed memory budgets, MANGO learns when to compress gradients, reduce momentum precision, or maintain full fidelity based on the current training phase.

## 1. Problem Formulation

### Core Insight
Training dynamics exhibit phase transitions where memory requirements vary:
- **Early training**: High gradient variance requires full precision
- **Mid training**: Gradient directions stabilize, allowing compression
- **Late training**: Fine-tuning needs selective high precision on critical parameters

### Mathematical Framework

Given a fixed memory budget M, we optimize the allocation:
```
M = M_grad(t) + M_momentum(t) + M_params
```

Where at each step t, we decide:
- **Gradient precision**: b_g ∈ {32, 16, 8, 4, 2} bits
- **Momentum precision**: b_m ∈ {32, 16, 8} bits  
- **Sparsity level**: s ∈ [0, 0.99] (fraction of zeros)

The optimization problem becomes:
```
min_θ L(θ) subject to Memory(b_g(t), b_m(t), s(t)) ≤ M
```

### Key Research Questions
1. How do optimal compression policies evolve during training?
2. Can we predict compression tolerance from local gradient statistics?
3. What convergence guarantees exist under adaptive compression?

## 2. Technical Approach

### 2.1 Compression Policy Network (CPN)

**Architecture**: Lightweight LSTM that observes training dynamics and outputs compression decisions.

**Input features** (per layer at step t):
- Gradient norm: ||g_t||
- Gradient variance: Var(g_{t-k:t})
- Momentum alignment: cos(m_t, g_t)
- Loss curvature estimate: (L_t - L_{t-1})/||θ_t - θ_{t-1}||²
- Training progress: t/T_total
- Layer-specific features: depth, parameter count, type

**Output actions**:
- Per-layer gradient bits: b_g^l
- Per-layer momentum bits: b_m^l
- Sparsification threshold: τ^l

### 2.2 Gradient Compression Module

**Adaptive Quantization**:
```python
def adaptive_quantize(grad, bits, importance_scores):
    if bits == 32:
        return grad
    elif bits >= 8:
        # Standard quantization with importance weighting
        scale = grad.abs().max() / (2^(bits-1) - 1)
        return torch.round(grad / scale) * scale
    else:
        # Top-k sparsification for extreme compression
        k = int(grad.numel() * (bits/32))
        values, indices = torch.topk(grad.abs(), k)
        sparse_grad = torch.zeros_like(grad)
        sparse_grad[indices] = grad[indices]
        return sparse_grad
```

**Error Feedback Mechanism**:
- Maintain error accumulation buffer: e_t = e_{t-1} + (g_t - compress(g_t))
- Inject error when it exceeds threshold

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning Framework

**State space**: Training dynamics features (gradient statistics, loss trajectory)

**Action space**: Compression configurations per layer

**Reward function**:
```
R(t) = -α·L(θ_t) + β·memory_saved(t) - γ·compression_error(t)
```

Where:
- α weights task loss
- β rewards memory efficiency  
- γ penalizes information loss

**Training approach**: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) for stable policy learning

## 4. Theoretical Contributions

### 4.1 Convergence Analysis

**Theorem 1** (Informal): Under mild assumptions, MANGO converges to a stationary point with rate O(1/√T) when compression error is bounded.

**Key proof sketch**:
1. Bound compression error: ||g_t - ĝ_t|| ≤ ε(t)
2. Show error accumulation is controlled via feedback
3. Apply standard SGD convergence with biased gradients

### 4.2 Phase Transition Theory

**Theorem 2**: Optimal compression policies exhibit phase transitions aligned with loss landscape geometry changes.

**Evidence needed**:
- Empirically show Hessian eigenvalue shifts correlate with policy changes
- Theoretical connection between local curvature and compression tolerance
